This list is woefully unfinished and nowhere close to exhaustive, if you're not on here and feel like you should be, you're probably right

My cofounder, Femi - for teaching me both how to think long term, the immense value of simulating an extrovert when you need to.

Max M - for being the cool-under-pressure rock i've needed on many occasions.

Y Combinator, and our partners - for teaching me almost all I know about startups, and taking a chance on me, even when I thought I wasn't worth taking a chance on.

Jayden W, Rachel Y - for showing me why faith is so powerful and important (even though I'm still agnostic I suppose, lol)

Jacky C - For teaching me the value of a growth mindset, especially when it comes to becoming a better programmer.

Paul D - For teaching me as a teenager that you don't have to be a snob to care about something deeply. (Obvious, I know! But a lesson that much needed learning for 17-year-old Evan)

David L - For teaching me the cold hard objectivity required to make tough tradeoffs

My Parents - For putting up with my non-traditional path in life and loving me unconditionally.

Russell C - For showing me that consistent progress on long projects, brick by brick, will build cities (both literally, and figuratively).

Tim Ferriss - For teaching me the value of gratitude, and getting me to start reading again

Tomiwa A - For brightening up my often solemn disposition

You! - For reading this.
